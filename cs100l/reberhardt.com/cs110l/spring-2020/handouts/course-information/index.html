<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>This class is focused on safety and robustness in systems programming: Where do
things often go wrong in computer systems? How can we avoid common pitfalls? We
will use the Rust programming language as a vehicle to teach mental models and
paradigms that have been shown to be helpful in preventing errors, and we will
look at how these features have made their way back into C++. The first three
weeks will focus on preventing many of the types of problems that you
encountered in CS 107: how can we prevent buffer overflows, memory leaks,
use-after-free bugs, and other sorts of memory errors? Then, we will focus on
preventing common mistakes that arise in the programming settings CS 110
covers: how do we write safe code when multiprocessing and multithreading are
involved? Check out the <a href="../course-material/index.html">syllabus</a> to see an overview of
course material.</p>
<p>Outside of lecture, there will be small weekly programming exercises to help
you reinforce the material; we expect these will take 1-3 hours to complete. In
addition, there will be two projects throughout the quarter that will involve
implementing something that you can be proud of. (Tentatively, the first
project will involve implementing a simple version of gdb, and the second
project will involve implementing a high-performance server.) There are no
exams.</p>
<h2 id="corequisite">Corequisite</h2>
<p>This class is designed to be taken along CS 110. If you have taken CS 110 in
the past, you may still enroll in CS 110L, but you may need to periodically
refresh your memory of CS 110 material. We will draw on some CS 107 material in
the first half of the quarter, but it&rsquo;s okay if you&rsquo;re a bit rusty. (Can you
find two bad puns in that sentence?)</p>
<p>Most of this class will be taught in Rust, and you are not expected to have any
prior exposure to Rust. However, we will refer to examples written in C and C++
throughout the class to compare different approaches of solving problems.</p>
<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>
<p>This class is graded on a CR/NC basis; you need to earn a 70% to pass. The
grade breakdown is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Project 1: 30%</li>
<li>Project 2: 30%</li>
<li>Weekly exercises: 20%</li>
<li>Participation: 20%</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are interested, you may replace any weekly exercise by writing and
publishing a blog post about your experience with something in the class. Did
you find a feature of Rust particularly hard to wrap your mind around? Was
there an idea we talked about that you found especially compelling? We think it
would be beneficial for you &ndash; and for the world! &ndash; if you shared these
reflections.</p>
<p>Additionally, you may replace any project with a project of your own that
relates more to your background or interests. If you have experience with
computer graphics, for example, you might be more interested in implementing a
raytracer in Rust. We are happy to suggest project ideas, and can help you
through the implementation process. Please let us know before you start if you
wish to pursue your own idea.</p>
<p>Late weekly exercises will not be accepted, although you can email us for an
extension if something comes up. Late projects will be accepted with a 10%
penalty per 24-hour late period, up to three days late.</p>
<p>We want this to be an enjoyable class for you. If you make a reasonable attempt
at all the work, you will have no problem passing.</p>
<h2 id="slack">Slack</h2>
<p>We&rsquo;re a small class, and part of the fun of taking a small class is getting to
know other people. The move to online classes has made this difficult, but we
have created a class Slack to restore some of that community aspect. Please
email us if you are taking the class and did not receive a Slack invite.</p>
<h2 id="software">Software</h2>
<p>If you would like to follow along on your personal computer, you may install
the Rust toolchain on your computer by following the instructions
<a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install">here</a>. However, the Rust toolchain is
also installed on <code>myth.stanford.edu</code>, and you can work on assignments there
just as you do in CS 107 and CS 110. We recommend working on <code>myth</code>, because it
can be tricky to get tools such as <code>gdb</code> to run properly on your own computer.
However, you are not required to do so.</p>
<h2 id="textbooks-and-resources">Textbooks and Resources</h2>
<p>This class has no textbook. However, if you are interested in additional
readings, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Rust-Fast-Systems-Development/dp/1491927283/">Programming
Rust</a>
and the free, online <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/">Rust book</a> are both
excellent resources.</p>
<h2 id="honor-code">Honor Code</h2>
<p><em>This portion was adopted from the CS 110 course information handout.</em></p>
<p>The honor code policy for this class is the same as that of CS 110.  Although
you are encouraged to discuss ideas with others, your work is to be completed
independently and should represent fully original work. Whenever you obtain
help, you should credit those who helped directly in your program, e.g. in a
program comment. Any assistance that is not given proper citation is considered
plagiarism, and a violation of the Stanford Honor Code. The following
activities are examples of what we consider to be honor code violations:</p>
<ol>
<li>Looking at another student&rsquo;s code.</li>
<li>Showing another student your code.</li>
<li>Discussing assignments in such detail that you duplicate a portion of
someone else&rsquo;s code in your own program.</li>
<li>Uploading your code to a public repository (e.g.
<strong><a href="https://github.com/"><code>github.com</code></a></strong> or
<strong><a href="https://bitbucket.com/"><code>bitbucket.com</code></a></strong>) so that others can easily
discover it via word of mouth or search engines. If you&rsquo;d like to upload
your code to a private repository, you can do so on Github or some other
hosting service that provides free-of-charge private hosting.</li>
</ol>
<p>Unfortunately, the CS department sees more than its fair share of Honor Code
violations. Because it&rsquo;s important that all cases of academic dishonesty be
identified for the sake of those playing by the rules, we exercise our right to
use software tools to compare your submissions against those of other students.</p>
