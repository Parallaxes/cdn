    <h1>Tips for SSH, Vim, iTerm, and more</h1>

    <p>CS 110 is many students&rsquo; first experience working with complex projects on the
command line. In this handout, I&rsquo;m attempting to aggregate resources that may
help you become more efficient. I use Mac OS, iTerm, and vim, and unfortunately
I don&rsquo;t know of too many resources for other platforms, but please make
suggestions and I&rsquo;ll aggregate the tools you all find helpful!</p>
<h2 id="general-ssh-tips">General SSH tips</h2>
<h3 id="avoid-ssh-timeouts">Avoid SSH timeouts</h3>
<p>If you let an SSH session sit too long without activity (sometimes even as
short as a few minutes), you&rsquo;ll often get connection issues:</p>
<pre><code>Write Failed: broken pipe
</code></pre><p>This is easy to mitigate by adding the following to <code>~/.ssh/config</code> (you may
need to create this file if it doesn&rsquo;t exist):</p>
<pre><code>Host *
    ServerAliveInterval 60
</code></pre><p>This works on Mac and Linux. It may also apply to Windows, depending on which
terminal emulator you&rsquo;re using (it should apply if you&rsquo;re using Ubuntu on
Windows).</p>
<h3 id="avoid-having-to-type-your-password-every-time">Avoid having to type your password every time</h3>
<p>Add this to your <code>~/.ssh/config</code>, replacing <code>yourSunetId</code> with your Stanford username:</p>
<pre><code>Host myth myth.stanford.edu
    HostName myth.stanford.edu
    User yourSunetId
    ControlMaster auto
    ControlPath ~/.ssh/%r@%h:%p
    ControlPersist yes
</code></pre><p>Now, you can simply type <code>ssh myth</code>. The first time, it&rsquo;ll ask you for your
password, but if you fire up more SSH sessions after that, it log in without
asking for credentials.</p>
<p>This works on OS X, and I believe it should work on Linux as well. If you&rsquo;re
using Ubuntu on Windows, you can try it, but I have no idea if it works.</p>
<h2 id="terminal-emulators">Terminal emulators</h2>
<h3 id="iterm2-os-x">iTerm2 (OS X)</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.iterm2.com/">https://www.iterm2.com/</a></p>
<p>iTerm is a replacement for the Terminal.app that ships with all Macs. I highly
recommend it; it&rsquo;s loaded with way more features than I know how to use, but
also designed very well such that those features never get in your way. You can
download it and start using it without knowing anything about it in particular.
The features I use most often:</p>
<ul>
<li>Split panes and split navigation (I am a vim user, and mapped &ldquo;go left&rdquo; to
cmd+option+H, &ldquo;go right&rdquo; to cmd+option+L, etc).</li>
<li>Quick scrollback reset options</li>
<li>Better tabbed navigation</li>
<li>A better search function</li>
<li>&ldquo;Instant replay,&rdquo; to see a history of things printed to the terminal</li>
<li>A built-in password manager</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="vim-pluginstips">Vim plugins/tips</h2>
<p>If you are new to vim, you can run <code>vimtutor</code> in your shell to get a
minimalistic text-based tutorial on how to use the editor. Even if you know
your way around, it may be worth skimming through the text; you may find
something useful you didn&rsquo;t know existed. <a href="http://www.openvim.com/">OpenVim</a> is
a nice interactive tutorial, and, if memory serves me correctly, it&rsquo;s how I got
started with vim. <a href="http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Tutorial">Wikia</a> has a good vim
cheat sheet.</p>
<p>There are many more features of vim than I can list here that make it
worthwhile to learn; sessions, macros, integrated <code>make</code>, a huge ecosystem of
plugins, and many other features make it more powerful than many other editors
around. I&rsquo;m only listing some tips that I think offer huge time savings, but
there&rsquo;s a lot more to learn!</p>
<h3 id="motions">Motions</h3>
<p>I think one of the biggest reasons people find vim painful is that it takes
them so long to move around a codebase and do the most basic things. There is
definitely a steep learning curve, but motions in vim are designed such that if
you learn how to use them well, you&rsquo;ll be faster than in any other editor.</p>
<p>You should get familiar with basic vim motions (<code>h</code> is left, <code>j</code> is down, <code>k</code>
is up, <code>l</code> is right&hellip; You can repeat motions, e.g. <code>5j</code> is &ldquo;move 5 lines
down&rdquo;). It&rsquo;s tempting to just use the arrow keys (or your mouse), but if you
practice using these motions, they eventually become second nature, and are
much faster than the navigation you may be used to.</p>
<p>Other useful motions:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>^</code> is &ldquo;move to the start of the line,&rdquo; and <code>$</code> is &ldquo;move to the end of the line&rdquo;</li>
<li><code>b</code> is &ldquo;move to the previous word,&rdquo; and <code>w</code> is &ldquo;move to the next word&rdquo;</li>
<li><code>}</code> is &ldquo;move to the next paragraph&rdquo; (or the next chunk of code), and <code>{</code> is
&ldquo;move to the previous paragraph&rdquo;</li>
<li><code>%</code> means &ldquo;move to the matching bracket or parentheses&rdquo; (e.g. if you&rsquo;re at
the opening bracket of a function and want to move to the end of a function)</li>
<li><code>f</code> allows you to jump to the next occurrence of a character, and <code>F</code> allows
you to jump to the last occurrence of a character. (e.g. <code>f(</code> will move you
to the next open parentheses)</li>
</ul>
<p>Motions are so useful because they can be combined with verbs. <code>y</code> is the copy
verb; <code>y3j</code> means &ldquo;copy the next 3 lines,&rdquo; and <code>y}</code> means &ldquo;copy from here until
the end of the paragraph.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="relative-line-numbers">Relative line numbers</h3>
<p>Relative line numbering is <em>super</em> useful. It makes your line numbers look like
this:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="../../../../blog/images/stanford-myth/04.png"/> 
</figure>

<p>If I want to delete from the current line (line 6) to the line reading <code>set incsearch</code>, I can look at the relative line numbering to the left, see that the
desired line is 5 lines down, and hit <code>d5j</code>. This makes
deleting/copying/selecting chunks of text <em>so much easier</em>.</p>
<p>When I switched, I found I didn&rsquo;t miss absolute line numbering at all. If I
needed to go to a specific line of a file, I&rsquo;d just type the number in and hit
<code>gg</code> to jump to that line (e.g. <code>55gg</code> to go to line 55).</p>
<p>To enable this behavior, add the following to your <code>~/.vimrc</code>:</p>
<pre><code>set number
set relativenumber
</code></pre><h3 id="enable-mouse-interaction">Enable mouse interaction</h3>
<p>I <em>think</em> this is now already enabled in the default <code>.vimrc</code> for new users at
Stanford, but I&rsquo;m not sure. If you add <code>set mouse=a</code> to your vimrc, you can
click around in the editor, scroll, drag to highlight, etc&hellip; In general, it is
better/faster to use a keyboard to navigate and do things, but sometimes being
able to use a mouse is nice.</p>
<h3 id="search">Search</h3>
<p>Add these lines to your .vimrc:</p>
<pre><code>&quot; Show search results as you type
set incsearch
&quot; Highlight all search results
set hlsearch
</code></pre><p>You can search using the <code>/</code> character (e.g. type <code>/hello</code> to find instances of
&ldquo;hello&rdquo; in your code). Press <code>n</code> to jump to the next instance of the search
result and <code>N</code> to jump to the previous instance.</p>
<h3 id="split-screening">Split screening</h3>
<p>Being able to see multiple files at the same time is super, super useful in
this class!</p>
<p>For easy split navigation, add this to your <code>.vimrc</code>:</p>
<pre><code>nnoremap &lt;C-J&gt; &lt;C-W&gt;&lt;C-J&gt;
nnoremap &lt;C-K&gt; &lt;C-W&gt;&lt;C-K&gt;
nnoremap &lt;C-L&gt; &lt;C-W&gt;&lt;C-L&gt;
nnoremap &lt;C-H&gt; &lt;C-W&gt;&lt;C-H&gt;
set splitbelow
set splitright
</code></pre><p>Now, to split the screen horizontally (i.e. to have two panes, one above each
other), in command mode, type <code>:sp</code> (for &ldquo;split&rdquo;). To split the screen
vertically (i.e. to have two panes side by side), type <code>:vsp</code>. To move up
(assuming you have the above nnoremaps in your config), press ctrl+k; to move
down, press ctrl+j; to move left, press ctrl+h; and to move right, press
ctrl+l.</p>
<p>Once you are in a split pane, you can load a file using <code>:e filename</code>, or using
FZF (see below).</p>

<li><a href="http://vimcasts.org/episodes/working-with-windows/">http://vimcasts.org/episodes/working-with-windows/</a> (video)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="marks">Marks</h3>
<p>Sometimes, you&rsquo;re working on some portion of code, and you want to briefly
glance up at some other part of a file before returning to where you&rsquo;re
working. You can set a mark where you&rsquo;re currently working by typing <code>ma</code>
(<em>mark a</em>), then scroll up to wherever you want to go, and then jump back down
to where you were before by typing <code>'a</code> (go back to mark a). You can set
multiple marks if you want (e.g. <code>mb</code> will set mark b), but I generally can
only keep track of one in my head&hellip;</p>
<h3 id="vundle">Vundle</h3>
<p>The following tips involve vim <em>plugins</em>.
<a href="https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim">Vundle</a> is a plugin manager to make
installing things easy. To install Vundle, run the following:</p>
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
</code></pre><p>Then, add the following towards the top of your <code>.vimrc</code> (if any of the
following lines are already in your vimrc, you can omit them):</p>
<pre><code>set nocompatible              &quot; be iMproved, required
filetype off                  &quot; required

&quot; set the runtime path to include Vundle and initialize
set rtp+=~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
call vundle#begin()

&quot; let Vundle manage Vundle, required
Plugin 'VundleVim/Vundle.vim'

&quot; Keep Plugin commands between vundle#begin/end.

&quot; ---------- ADD Plugin DECLARATIONS HERE ---------

&quot; All of your Plugins must be added before the following line
call vundle#end()            &quot; required
filetype plugin indent on    &quot; required
</code></pre><p>My tips below mention <code>Plugin</code> declarations. Add those lines where indicated at
the dashed line above. Every time you add a new plugin to your <code>.vimrc</code>, save
the <code>.vimrc</code> file and then run <code>:PluginInstall</code> to install the new plugin.</p>
<h3 id="deoplete-autocomplete">Deoplete (autocomplete)</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Shougo/deoplete.nvim">Deoplete</a> provides autocomplete
suggestions, making vim behave a bit more like an IDE.</p>
<p><img src="../../../../../cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7141867/11717030/ae809a28-9f73-11e5-8c12-79fe9c460401.png" alt=""></p>
<p>To use it, you will need vim 8 and Python 3.6.1. All the myth machines are
running vim 8, but if you are doing this on your personal computer, you may
need to upgrade. (Try <code>brew install vim</code> on a Mac.) You will also need to
install pynvim:</p>
<pre><code>pip3 install --user pynvim
</code></pre><p>Then, you can add the following to your vim config:</p>
<pre><code>Plugin 'Shougo/deoplete.nvim'
Plugin 'roxma/nvim-yarp'
Plugin 'roxma/vim-hug-neovim-rpc'
let g:deoplete#enable_at_startup = 1
&quot; deoplete tab-complete
inoremap &lt;expr&gt;&lt;tab&gt; pumvisible() ? &quot;\&lt;c-n&gt;&quot; : &quot;\&lt;tab&gt;&quot;
</code></pre><p>If you can&rsquo;t use vim 8 for whatever reason,
<a href="https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe#ubuntu-linux-x64">YouCompleteMe</a> is
another good autocomplete alternative.</p>
<h3 id="fzf-fuzzy-file-finder">fzf (Fuzzy file finder)</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf">fzf</a> is an excellent plugin for quickly
navigating to files without closing vim. You may see me do this in lecture; I
press my spacebar twice, enter a few characters that are part of the filename I
want, then select the desired file, and voila, it&rsquo;s open!</p>
<p>It has been a long time since I installed this, and I&rsquo;m forgetting some
details. Try these instructions and please let me know if you run into problems
on myth.</p>
<p>Run this in your shell:</p>
<pre><code>git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.git ~/.fzf
~/.fzf/install
</code></pre><p>Then add this to your <code>.vimrc</code> (see Vundle instructions above):</p>
<pre><code>set rtp+=~/.fzf
Plugin 'junegunn/fzf'
Plugin 'junegunn/fzf.vim'
&quot; This is the default extra key bindings
let g:fzf_action = {
  \ 'ctrl-t': 'tab split',
  \ 'ctrl-x': 'split',
  \ 'ctrl-v': 'vsplit' }

&quot; Default fzf layout
&quot; - down / up / left / right
let g:fzf_layout = { 'down': '~40%' }

&quot; space space to open fzf file finder
let mapleader = &quot;\&lt;Space&gt;&quot;
nnoremap &lt;silent&gt; &lt;leader&gt;&lt;space&gt; :Files&lt;CR&gt;

&quot; Enable hidden buffers (don't need to save when switching files)
set hidden
</code></pre><p>Press &ldquo;space space&rdquo; to open fzf. To open a file, hit enter. To split the screen
vertically and open the file in the new split pane, press ctrl+v; to split
horizontally, press ctrl+x.</p>
<video autoplay muted loop style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto">
    <source src="fzf.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>
<h3 id="ag-silver-searcher">ag (Silver Searcher)</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher">ag</a> lets you quickly find files
containing a search term. Need to know where the <code>inode</code> struct is defined?
Just type <code>:Ag struct inode {</code> and you can easily open <code>ino.h</code> from there.</p>
<p>Again, it has been years since I installed this, and the installation
instructions have since changed, so let me know if you run into problems.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll need to <a href="https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher#installing">install ag</a> first; on Mac,
this is just <code>brew install the_silver_searcher</code>, but check the linked README
for instructions on other platforms. Then, add this to your <code>.vimrc</code>:</p>
<pre><code>Plugin 'mileszs/ack.vim'
let g:ackprg = 'ag --vimgrep --smart-case'
cnoreabbrev ag Ack
cnoreabbrev aG Ack
cnoreabbrev Ag Ack
cnoreabbrev AG Ack
</code></pre><video autoplay muted loop style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto">
    <source src="ag.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>
<h3 id="airline">Airline</h3>
<p>This is a really great plugin for formatting the vim display. I have it showing
my currently-open files at the top of the screen, and I can press &ldquo;space 3&rdquo; to
switch to the 3rd &ldquo;tab.&rdquo;</p>
<pre><code>Plugin 'vim-airline/vim-airline'
let g:airline#extensions#tabline#enabled = 1
&quot;set airline 
let g:airline#extensions#tabline#tab_nr_type = 1 &quot; tab number
let g:airline#extensions#tabline#show_tab_nr = 1
let g:airline#extensions#tabline#formatter = 'default'
let g:airline#extensions#tabline#buffer_nr_show = 1
let g:airline#extensions#tabline#fnametruncate = 20
let g:airline#extensions#tabline#fnamecollapse = 2
let g:airline#extensions#tabline#buffer_idx_mode = 1

nmap &lt;leader&gt;1 &lt;Plug&gt;AirlineSelectTab1
nmap &lt;leader&gt;2 &lt;Plug&gt;AirlineSelectTab2
nmap &lt;leader&gt;3 &lt;Plug&gt;AirlineSelectTab3
nmap &lt;leader&gt;4 &lt;Plug&gt;AirlineSelectTab4
nmap &lt;leader&gt;5 &lt;Plug&gt;AirlineSelectTab5
nmap &lt;leader&gt;6 &lt;Plug&gt;AirlineSelectTab6
nmap &lt;leader&gt;7 &lt;Plug&gt;AirlineSelectTab7
nmap &lt;leader&gt;8 &lt;Plug&gt;AirlineSelectTab8
nmap &lt;leader&gt;9 &lt;Plug&gt;AirlineSelectTab9
</code></pre><video autoplay muted loop style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto">
    <source src="airline.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>
<h3 id="rust-specific-plugins">Rust-specific plugins</h3>
<h4 id="rustvim">Rust.vim</h4>
<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust.vim">Rust.vim</a> provides Rust syntax
highlighting and formatting, and sets a foundations for some other plugins
(such as Syntastic). I would highly recommend installing this. Note that this
plugin requires vim 8 for full functionality. Vim 8 is already installed on
myth, but if you are installing on your local machine, you may need to upgrade
(e.g. <code>brew install vim</code> on Mac).</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my vim config:</p>
<pre><code>Plugin 'rust-lang/rust.vim'
let g:rustfmt_autosave = 1
</code></pre><p>This will run <code>rustfmt</code> on save, so that your code is automatically formatted
for standard style.</p>
<h4 id="syntastic">Syntastic</h4>
<p><a href="https://github.com/vim-syntastic/syntastic">Syntastic</a> checks your code for
syntax errors. This plugin requires that you have Rust.vim installed. I have it
configured so that every time I save, it will highlight any compiler errors,
which is pretty handy.</p>
<p>The following is my vim configuration:</p>
<pre><code>Plugin 'vim-syntastic/syntastic'
let g:syntastic_always_populate_loc_list = 1
let g:syntastic_auto_loc_list = 1
let g:syntastic_check_on_wq = 0
</code></pre><h4 id="vim-racer">Vim Racer</h4>
<p><a href="https://github.com/racer-rust/vim-racer">Vim Racer</a> is probably the most
useful Rust vim plugin in my opinion. It adds &ldquo;smart&rdquo; autocomplete options; for
example, if you type <code>SomeStruct.</code>, it will list the fields inside of
<code>SomeStruct</code> as autocomplete options. Additionally, it allows you to jump to
code definitions. If you have your cursor on a function, you can type <code>gd</code> to
<strong>g</strong>o to the <strong>d</strong>efinition of that function (or <code>gs</code> to open the definition
in a split pane, <code>gx</code> to open in a vertical split pane, or <code>gt</code> to open in a
new tab). This even works with library functions, which is quite useful when
you&rsquo;re trying to figure out how a function is supposed to be used and you want
to jump to its source code and comments without having to search online.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll need to install <a href="https://github.com/phildawes/racer">racer</a> before you
can use this plugin.</p>
<pre><code>Plugin 'racer-rust/vim-racer'
set hidden
let g:racer_cmd = &quot;/Users/reberhardt/.cargo/bin/racer&quot;
let g:racer_experimental_completer = 1
augroup Racer
    autocmd!
    autocmd FileType rust nmap &lt;buffer&gt; gd         &lt;Plug&gt;(rust-def)
    autocmd FileType rust nmap &lt;buffer&gt; gs         &lt;Plug&gt;(rust-def-split)
    autocmd FileType rust nmap &lt;buffer&gt; gx         &lt;Plug&gt;(rust-def-vertical)
    autocmd FileType rust nmap &lt;buffer&gt; gt         &lt;Plug&gt;(rust-def-tab)
    autocmd FileType rust nmap &lt;buffer&gt; &lt;leader&gt;gd &lt;Plug&gt;(rust-doc)
augroup END
</code></pre><h2 id="emacs">Emacs</h2>
<p>Sadly, I know so little about emacs that I&rsquo;m not sure I even know how to save a
file. Please send me recommendations, and I&rsquo;ll post them here!</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>For Rust, check out <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-mode">rust-mode</a>.</p>
<h2 id="sublime-text">Sublime Text</h2>
<p>Supposedly, Rust support in Sublime is pretty good already, but the
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-enhanced">Rust Enhanced</a> plugin adds some
extra features.</p>
<h2 id="intellij">IntelliJ</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve never used IntelliJ before, you should check it out; it&rsquo;s a very
powerful and capable editor, and the professional edition is
<a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students"><em>free</em> for students</a>!
Do note, however, that it is a pretty big memory hog and tends to slaughter my
Macbook Air.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re using IntelliJ, check out the official <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8182-rust">Rust plugin</a>.</p>
<h2 id="other-fun-things">Other fun things</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://fendrich.se/blog/2012/09/28/no/">zsh</a> is my shell of choice,
supporting many nice features over bash. (Honestly, I depend on so many tiny
features that I don&rsquo;t even remember them being unique to zsh anymore.)
<a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh">oh-my-zsh</a> makes it easy to try
