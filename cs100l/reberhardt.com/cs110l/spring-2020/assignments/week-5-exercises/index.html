    <h1>Week 5 Exercises: Farm meets multithreading</h1>

    <p>Excellent job on making it past the halfway point of the quarter! We&rsquo;re so
proud of all of your progress, and we hope you feel accomplished as well!</p>
<p>The goal of this week&rsquo;s exercise is to get you thinking about multithreading
material and to help you ask questions about lecture material that still feels
confusing. Please ask questions! The exercise is designed to be light in order
to give you time to focus on Project 1, and should take approximately an hour.</p>
<p><strong>Due date:</strong> Saturday, May 16, 11:59pm (Pacific time)</p>
<p>We can extend this deadline for you if you are having a really rough week.
Message us letting us know what&rsquo;s up, and we&rsquo;d be happy to work with you!</p>
<p><em>Ping us on Slack if you are having difficulty with this assignment. We would
love to help clarify any misunderstandings, and we want you to sleep!</em></p>
<h2 id="getting-the-code">Getting the code</h2>
<p>The starter code is available on GitHub
<a href="https://github.com/reberhardt7/cs110l-spr-2020-starter-code">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="part-1-farm">Part 1: Farm</h2>
<p>This week, we&rsquo;ll take a stab at implementing a simplified version of <code>farm</code>
from your CS 110 assignment 3. One twist: we&rsquo;ll use multithreading instead of
multiprocessing!</p>
<p>This version of <code>farm</code> will receive the numbers to factor using command line
arguments instead of reading from <code>stdin</code>. It can be run like so:</p>
<pre><code>🍉 cargo run 12345678 12346789 34567890 45678902
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.29s
     Running `target/debug/farm 12345678 12346789 34567890 45678902`
Farm starting on 8 CPUs
12345678 = 2 * 3 * 3 * 47 * 14593 [time: 420.687768ms]
12346789 = 7 * 13 * 19 * 37 * 193 [time: 678.612537ms]
34567890 = 2 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 97 * 1697 [time: 1.176596148s]
45678902 = 2 * 433 * 52747 [time: 1.812403818s]
Total execution time: 1.812585221s
</code></pre><p>You can implement this version of <code>farm</code> in three steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, establish the queue of numbers to factor. You will want to use the
<code>get_input_numbers()</code> function that we have provided. You may draw on lecture
examples to make this queue safe to access from multiple threads.</li>
<li>Spawn <code>num_threads</code> worker threads. In each thread, using a loop, pop a
number off the queue and factor that number (by calling <code>factor_number</code>)
until no numbers remain on the queue.
<ul>
<li>You should be careful to think about when the thread holds the mutex.
You&rsquo;ll need to hold the mutex while accessing the queue, but you should
not hold it when factoring a number to avoid serializing the work. We
highly recommend writing a helper function that borrows a reference to
your <code>Mutex&lt;VecDeque&lt;u32&gt;&gt;</code>, pops a number from the front of the queue,
and returns <code>Option&lt;u32&gt;</code> (note that <code>VecDeque::pop_front</code> conveniently
returns <code>Option&lt;u32&gt;</code>). This way, the lock is only held for the duration
of that function. You can tell the queue has become empty when that
function returns <code>None</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Wait for all of your threads to finish by calling <code>thread.join()</code> on each of
them. If you don&rsquo;t do this, your program will compile fine, but you may have
problems where some numbers are missing from the output because the program
exited before the threads could finish.</li>
</ul>
<p>It may be helpful for you to reference the ticket agents Attempt 3 code from
Lecture 10.</p>
<p>When you run your program, pay attention to the total execution time printed at
the end of the program. If it is significantly longer than the time taken to
factor any one number, you may be accidentally serializing your program by
holding a lock for too long.</p>
<p><em>Fun fact:</em> This implementation is made significantly easier by the fact that
we have all the numbers to factor up front (from <code>argv</code>) instead of receiving
them at some point via <code>stdin</code>. Your CS 110 <code>farm</code> implementation needed to
contend with the fact that an empty queue does <em>not</em> mean workers can exit
(they need to stick around in case another number arrives later via <code>stdin</code>).
Here, workers can pull numbers directly off the queue (there is no main process
broadcasting numbers to workers), and workers can exit as soon as the queue
becomes empty, since there is no way for additional numbers to come in. In the
coming weeks, you&rsquo;ll learn how to manage worker threads in cases where
additional work might arrive after a queue becomes empty, and you&rsquo;ll implement
such a program in CS 110 assignment 6.</p>
